	<p style="text-align: justify;">I work as a sales assistant in retail at Parkson Klang Parade during my semester break from August to September  in 2023. I only work for one month as the period of my semester break is already finished. I get to have experience working in retail stores. There are shifts working such as morning and afternoon. I have experience working in both shifts. It was quite challenging after working the afternoon shift and the next day I needed to come to work in the morning. I was quite amazed with myself because I could survive and have experience in working.
	</p>

	<p style="text-align:justify"> I never thought I would have the courage to work during my semester break. It was my first working experience. I think it was good for me to be exposed to the working world.I am hoping that I will get more opportunities to work anytime I can. </p><br>
